# Address PR Comments

## When to use

- A PR has unresolved review comments
- You need systematic comment-by-comment remediation

## Instructions

1. Determine PR number and fetch comments via `gh` APIs.
3. Once comments are available, categorize into bugs, suggestions, nitpicks, and questions.
5. Resolve review threads through GraphQL for comments that are fixed or intentionally accepted as no-change. Do not leave bot comment threads open.

## Rules

- Do not silently ignore comments
- In `blocking` mode, continue polling until bot comments appear or a clear timeout/error condition occurs.
- In non-blocking mode, do not idle; report status and wait for a later re-run.
- Do not add low-value rebuttal noise. If a bot suggestion is clearly incorrect and not worth discussion, skip the reply and move on.
- Reply when context is genuinely useful (non-obvious tradeoff, partial acceptance, or reason for leaving code as-is).
- Add tests when comments expose missing behavior coverage
- Prioritize correctness and high-signal feedback first
