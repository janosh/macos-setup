# Refine Implementation Plan

## When to use

- Before implementing a non-trivial feature or refactor
- When requirements or approach still have gaps

## Instructions

1. Draft approach: what to build, order, and how pieces connect.
2. Self-critique for vague steps, missing error handling, unstated assumptions, and unclear dependencies.
3. List uncertainties (ambiguous requirements, unknown constraints, open design choices).
5. Ask the user numbered questions for those remaining; wait for answers before coding.
6. Revise into concrete steps with explicit edge cases and interfaces.
7. Present the final plan and confirm before implementation.

## Rules

- Planning only — no implementation code yet.
- Replace hand-wavy steps with precise actions.
- Don't ask what you can derive; batch only genuine judgment calls and iterate if answers reveal new gaps.

## Outcome

An agreed implementation plan ready to execute without guesswork.
