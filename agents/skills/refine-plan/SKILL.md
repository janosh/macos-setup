# Refine Implementation Plan

## When to use

- Before implementing a non-trivial feature or refactor
- When requirements or approach still have gaps

## Instructions

1. Draft approach: what to build, order, and how pieces connect.
2. Self-critique for vague steps, missing error handling, unstated assumptions, and unclear dependencies.
3. List uncertainties (ambiguous requirements, unknown constraints, open design choices).
4. Resolve every uncertainty you can yourself first — read the code, run things, check docs/history. Dispatch read-only research subagents only when independent unknowns each require deep exploration and serial research clearly costs more than dispatch and synthesis. Only escalate the genuinely undecidable ones (product intent, ambiguous requirements, external constraints).
5. Ask the user numbered questions for those remaining; wait for answers before coding.
6. Revise into concrete steps with explicit edge cases and interfaces.
7. Present the final plan and confirm before implementation.

## Rules

- Planning only — no implementation code yet.
- Replace hand-wavy steps with precise actions.
- Don't ask what you can derive; batch only genuine judgment calls and iterate if answers reveal new gaps.

## Outcome

An agreed implementation plan ready to execute without guesswork.
