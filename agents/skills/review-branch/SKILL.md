# Review Branch

## When to use

- Branch is ready for full review before PR
- You need architecture/correctness/style assessment across all branch changes

## Instructions

1. Inspect branch scope (`git log main..HEAD`, diff stats, full diff).
3. Identify bugs, performance concerns, and code smells.
4. Rank findings by impact.
5. Implement confident fixes immediately; collect clarifications if needed.

## Rules

- Review entire branch diff, not only latest commit
- Prioritize correctness and regressions over stylistic polish
